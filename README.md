Pete the Penguin is a first-person survival/action game for PC. The game takes place in Antarctica in the year 3000, where World War V has ended. The world is uninhabitable: the only safe place left is Antarctica, in which radiated monsters surround this land. Antarctica has one last remaining holdout, a small colony of surviving scientists and native penguins. Playing the role of Pete the Penguin, the player must fight against the enemies created from the war and hold this ground against all odds.
